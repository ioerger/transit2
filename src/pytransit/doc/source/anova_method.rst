ANOVA
=====

The Anova (Analysis of variance) method is used to determine which genes
exhibit statistically significant variability of insertion counts across multiple conditions.
Unlike other methods which take a comma-separated list of wig files as input,
the method takes a *combined_wig* file (which combined multiple datasets in one file)
and a *samples_metadata* file (which describes which samples/replicates belong
to which experimental conditions).

|

How does it work?
-----------------

The method performs the `One-way anova test <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance?oldformat=true#The_F-test>`_ for each gene across conditions.
It takes into account variability of normalized transposon insertion counts among TA sites
and among replicates,
to determine if the differences among the mean counts for each condition are significant.


Example
-------

::

  > python3 transit.py anova <combined_wig_file> <metadata_file> <annotation_file> <output_file> [Optional Arguments]
        Optional Arguments:
         --n <string>                     := Normalization method. Default: --n TTR
         --exclude-conditions <cond1,...> := Comma separated list of conditions to ignore for the analysis. Default: None
         --include-conditions <cond1,...> := Comma separated list of conditions to include for the analysis. Default: All
         --ref <cond>                     := which condition(s) to use as a reference for calculating LFCs (comma-separated if multiple conditions) (by default, LFCs for each condition are computed relative to the grandmean across all condintions)
         --iN <float>                     := Ignore TAs occurring within given percentage (as integer) of the N terminus. Default: --iN 0
         --iC <float>                     := Ignore TAs occurring within given percentage (as integer) of the C terminus. Default: --iC 0
         --PC <N>                         := Pseudocounts to use in calculating LFCs. Default: --PC 5
         --alpha <N>                      := value added to MSE in F-test for moderated anova (makes genes with low counts less significant). Default: --alpha 1000
         -winz                            := winsorize insertion counts for each gene in each condition 
                                             (replace max count in each gene with 2nd highest; helps mitigate effect of outliers)


Input files
-----------

For description of input file formats, see documentation 
on :ref:`Combined wig files <combined_wig_link>`
and :ref:`Metadata files <metadata_files>`.


Parameters
----------

The following parameters are available for the ANOVA method:

-  **\-\-include-conditions:** Includes the given set of conditions from the ZINB test. Conditions not in this list are ignored. Note: this is useful for specifying the order in which the columns are listed in the output file.

-  **\-\-exclude-conditions:** Can use this to drop conditions not of interest.

-  **\-\-ref:** Specify which condition to use as a reference for computing LFCs.
   By default, LFCs for each gene in each condition are calculated with respect
   to the *grand mean* count across all conditions (so conditions with higher counts will be balanced
   with conditions with lower counts).  However, if there is a defined reference condition
   in the data, it may be specified using **\-\-ref** (in which case LFCs for that condition will
   be around 0, and will be positive or negative for the other conditions, depending on whether
   counts are higher or lower than the reference condition.  If there is more than one
   condition to use as reference (i.e. pooled), they may be given as a comma-separated list.

-  **--n**: Normalization Method. Determines which normalization method to
   use when comparing datasets. Proper normalization is important as it
   ensures that other sources of variability are not mistakenly treated
   as real differences. See the :ref:`Normalization <normalization>` section for a description
   of normalization method available in TRANSIT. Default: -n TTR

-  **--PC <N>**: Pseudocounts to use in calculating LFCs (see below). Default: -PC 5

-  **--alpha <N>**:  Value added to MSE in F-test for moderated ANOVA: F = MSR/(MSE+alpha).
   This is helpful because genes with very low counts are occasionally ranked as significant
   by traditional ANOVA, even though the apparent variability is probably due to noise.
   Setting alpha to a number like 1000 helps filter out these irrelevant genes 
   by reducing their significance. If you want to emulate the 
   standard ANOVA test, you can set alpha to 0.  Default: -alpha 1000

-  **-winz**: `winsorize <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsorizing>`_ insertion counts for each gene in each condition. 
   Replace max count in each gene with 2nd highest.  This can help mitigate effect of outliers.


Output and Diagnostics
----------------------

The output file generated by ANOVA identifies which genes exhibit statistically
significant variability in insertion counts across conditions.

The ANOVA method outputs a tab-delimited file with results for each
gene in the genome. P-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons using
the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (called "q-values" or "p-adj."). A
typical threshold for conditional essentiality on is q-value < 0.05.

**LFCs** (log-fold-changes):
For each condition, the LFC is calculated as the log-base-2 of the
ratio of mean insertion count in that condition **relative to the mean of means across all the conditions**.
You can use the **'\-\-ref' flag** to designate a specific condition as a reference for computing LFCs.
Pseudocount are incorporated to reduce the impact of noise on LFCs, based on the formula below.
The pseudocounts can be adjusted using the '\-\-PC' flag.
Changing the pseudocounts (via \-\-PC) can reduce the artifactual appearance of genes with
high-magnitude LFCs but that have small overall counts (which are susceptible to noise).
Changing the pseudocounts will not affect the analysis of statistical significance and hence number of varying genes, however.

::

  LFC = log2((mean_insertions_in_condition + PC)/(mean_of_means_across_all_conditions + PC))
