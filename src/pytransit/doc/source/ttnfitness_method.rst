TTN-Fitness
===========

TTN-Fitness provides a method for estimating the fitness of genes in a single
condition, while correcting for biases in Himar1 insertion preferences at TA sites
based on surrounding nucleotides. The frequency of insertions depends on nucleotides
surrounding TA sites. This model captures that effect.

Typically with individual TnSeq datasets, Gumbel and HMM are the methods used for
evaluating essentiality. Gumbel distinguishes between ES (essential) from NE (non-essential).
HMM adds the GD (growth-defect; suppressed counts; mutant has reduced fitness) and
GA (growth advantage; inflated counts; mutant has selective advantage) categories.
Quantifying the magnitude of the fitness defect is risky because the counts at
individual TA sites can be noisy. Sometimes the counts at a TA site in a gene can span
a wide range of very low to very high counts. The TTN-Fitness gives a more fine-grained analysis
of the degree of fitness effect by taking into account the insertion preferences of the Himar1 transposon.

These insertion preferences are influenced by the nucleotide context of each TA site.  The TTN-Fitness
method uses a statistical model based on surrounding nucleotides to estimate the insertion bias of each site.
Then, it corrects for this to compute an overall fitness level as a Fitness Ratio, where the ratio is 0 for
ES genes, 1 for typical NE genes, between 0 and 1 for GD genes and above 1 for GA genes.

For additional details, see our paper:

`Choudhery, Sanjeevani et al. “Modeling Site-Specific Nucleotide Biases Affecting Himar1 Transposon Insertion
Frequencies in TnSeq Data Sets.” mSystems vol. 6,5 (2021): e0087621. doi:10.1128/mSystems.00876-21 <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34665010/>`_

* This methodology is best suited for libraries created with the Himar1 transposon.
* The model itself does not need to be re-trained to make prediction on a dataset. Our data (Choudhery, 2021) shows
  this model generalizes across other bacterial species.
* This methodology can handle multiple replicates. More replicates increase the saturation of TA sites in non-essential
  genes. This allows for higher accuracy and precision of the insertion counts at TA sites of a genome.

Note that the TTN-Fitness model is primarily aimed at analyzing GD (growth-defect) genes (and NE, GA) in terms of magnitudes of counts,
but not really ES/ESB genes, which are determined by other analyses (based on absence of insertions). ES genes are
essential genes have been previously labeled as such by the Gumbel method. ESB genes
are genes that have no insertions and are are long enough to be significant by a Binomial
method (see paper).  Since counts are so close to 0 for these, the insertion biased on
the transposon is irrelevant.  Thus, the predictive model is not really used for these genes.

TTN-Fitness is more sensitive to deviations in insertion counts
(compared to expected insertion counts) and therefore tends to call
more GD and GA genes than other analysis methods.



Usage
------

::

  >  python3 transit.py ttnfitness <combined wig file> <metadata_file> <annotation_file> <condition to analyze> <genome .fna> <gumbel output file> <gene-wise output file> <ta-site wise output file>

    -  gumbel output file: The Gumbel method must be run first on the dataset. The output of the Gumbel method is provided as an input 
       to this method. ES (essential by Gumbel) and ESB (essential by Binomial) is calculated in the TTN-Fitness method via this files


GUI Mode
--------
TTN Fitness can be access though the "Method" tab in the Menu Bar.
    .. image:: _images/ttnfitness_selection_gui.png
       :width: 1000
       :align: center

The parameters to input through the parameter panel for the method is equivalent to the command line usage, except
in the GUI format we name the output files using the prefix passed in.
    .. image:: _images/ttnfitness_parameter_panel.png
       :width: 1000
       :align: center

Ensure that the gumbel file uploaded is of the condition selected

Volcano Plot
--------
After TTN-Fitness is run, the two output files will appear in the results panel. When selected, both files show Display Table as a
possible action. The Genes file also has a Display Volcano Plot action. 

    .. image:: _images/ttnfitness_results_area_action.png
       :width: 600
       :align: center

When selected, file dialog will appear to save the image and the volcano plot will also be added to the results area. When selected and the 
"Display Image" action is performed, the folowing image should appear:

    .. image:: _images/ttnfitness_volcano.png
       :width: 400
       :align: center

The horizonal line is the log10 adjusted pval, above which genes are marked NE. The vertical line is where the coefficient of the model is 0, 
below which siginifnicant genes are marked "GD" and above which siginificant genes are marked "GA"


Output
------

There are two outputs files. One file details the assessment per gene and one details the assessment per TA site.

The first output file is a tab-delimited file where the last column, titled TTN-Fitness Calls reports the essentiality call of
each given gene. The call is one of following:

* NE = Non-essential.
* ES = essential based on Gumbel
* ESB = essential based on Binomial**
* GA = Growth Advantage
* GD = Growth Defect
* U = Uncertain [for genes that are too short]

** this is an alternative model for identifying essential genes that complements the Gumbel calculation, which tends to 
call short genes with few TA sites Uncertain, especially at lower levels of saturation; see Choudhery et al, 2021

The Fitness Ratio reported in this file is a modification of the M1 coefficient to reflect the amount of fitness defect per gene.
This ratio was calculated as:

.. math::

   Fitness \ Ratio = e^{(M1\ coefficient - median[M1\ coefficients])}


This value ranges from 0 to infinity.
Genes with a value around 1 are non-essential.
If less than 1, this value indicates the level of growth defect
that is caused by disruption of the gene by transpoon insertion.
The closer the ratio of a gene is to 0, the more essential a gene is.
If greater than 1, it indicates the level of growth advantage of the mutant.
The histograms below shows the distribution of the fitness ratios calculated
for each of the essentiality categories. The genes
assessed as GD have a ratio that is typically below 0.5,
those labeled GA are mostly above 1.0 and the ratios of genes assessed
as NE have a peak at 1 and are restricted to the center of the plot.

The Fitness Ratio quantifies the qualitative calls seen in the TTN-Fitness Calls Column. These two columns are the last two
columns in the output file and are the primary columns per gene reflecting the assessments made by our model.

Example of running the TTN-Fitness methodology on the sample glycerol data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Run the Gumbel Analysis
:: 
  python3 transit.py gumbel cholesterol_glycerol.transit/comwig.tsv cholesterol_glycerol.transit/metadata.tsv H37Rv.prot_table Glycerol gylcerol_H37Rv.gumbel.out

2. Use the output of the Gumbel Analysis as the input to the TTN-Fitness method
::
  python3 transit.py ttnfitness cholesterol_glycerol.transit/comwig.tsv cholesterol_glycerol.transit/metadata.tsv H37Rv.prot_table Glycerol H37Rv.fna glycerol_H37Rv.gumbel.out ttnfitness_glycerol_H37Rv_gene.txt ttnfitness_glycerol_H37Rv_TAsite.txt

The resulting ttnfitness_glycerol_H37Rv_gene.txt out should contain TTN Fitness Assessments breakdown similar to:

* 172 ES
* 501 ESB
* 2680 NE
* 195 GA
* 359 GD
* 72 U

The resulting ttnfitness_glycerol_H37Rv_TAsite.txt should contain 62,622 TA sites


Run-time
--------
On an average machine, running this methodology on a dataset takes about 5 minutes. (TTN Fitness does not give progress updates, so be patient.)
