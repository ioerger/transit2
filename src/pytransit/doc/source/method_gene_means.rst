Gene Means
===========

From a combined_wig file, calculate the mean count in each gene
for each sample (column), of for each condition (averaged over replicates) using --avg_by_cond flag.


Params: -n, -iC, and -N are especially important

--avg_by_cond?

Is there anything to say about the format of the output file?
