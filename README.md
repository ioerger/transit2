[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/mad-lab/transit.svg)](https://github.com/mad-lab/transit)   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mad-lab/transit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mad-lab/transit)   [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/transit/badge/?version=latest)](http://transit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)   [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/tnseq-transit)](https://pepy.tech/project/tnseq-transit)


**NOTE: TRANSIT v3.0+ now requires python3.6+. If you want to use TRANSIT with python2, use version < 3.0.**

Welcome! This is the distribution for the TRANSIT and TPP tools developed by the [Ioerger Lab](http://orca2.tamu.edu/tom/iLab.html) at Texas A&M University.

TRANSIT is a tool for processing and statistical analysis of Tn-Seq data.
It provides an easy to use graphical interface and access to three different analysis methods that allow the user to determine essentiality in a single condition as well as between conditions.

## Features
TRANSIT offers a variety of features including:

-   More than **10 analysis methods**, including methods for determining **conditional essentiality** as well as **genetic interactions**.

-   Ability to analyze datasets from libraries constructed using  **himar1 or tn5 transposons**.

-   **TrackView** to help visualize read-counts across the genome.

-   Can **export datasets** into a variety of formats, including **IGV**.

-   Includes a **variety of normalization methods**.

-   **Quality Control** diagnostics, to idenfity poor quality datasets.

-   Ability to install as a **python package**, to import and use in your own personal scripts.
