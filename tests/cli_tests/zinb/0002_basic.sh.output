 python3 ./src/transit.py  zinb <combined wig file> <samples_metadata file> <annotation .prot_table_path> <output file> [Optional Arguments]
Optional Arguments:
    -n <string>         :=  Normalization method. Default: -n TTR
    --exclude-conditions <cond1,cond2> :=  Comma separated list of conditions to exclude, for the analysis.
    --include-conditions <cond1,cond2> :=  Comma separated list of conditions to include, for the analysis. Conditions not in this list, will be excluded.
    --ref <cond>    := which condition(s) to use as a reference for calculating log_fold_changes (comma-separated if multiple conditions)
    -iN <float>     := Ignore TAs occuring within given percentage (as integer) of the N terminus. Default: -iN 5
    -iC <float>     := Ignore TAs occuring within given percentage (as integer) of the C terminus. Default: -iC 5
    -winz           := winsorize insertion counts for each gene in each condition (replace max cnt with 2nd highest; helps mitigate effect of outliers)
    -PC <N>         := pseudocounts to use for calculating log_fold_changes. Default: -PC 5
    --group-by      := columnname (in samples_metadata) to use as the Condition. Default: "Condition"
    --condition     := alias for --group-by
    --covars <covar1,covar2...>       := Comma separated list of covariates (in metadata file) to include, for the analysis.
    --interactions <covar1,covar2...> := Comma separated list of covariates to include, that interact with the condition for the analysis. Must be factors
    --prot_table_path <filename>           := for appending annotations of genes
    --gene <RV number or Gene name>   := Run method for one gene and print model output.
