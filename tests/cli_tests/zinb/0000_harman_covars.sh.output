Usage:
     python3 ./src/transit.py  zinb <combined_wig_file> <annotation_file> <metadata_file> <output_file> [Optional Arguments]

Optional Arguments:
    -exclude-conditions <cond1,cond2> :=  Comma separated list of conditions to exclude, for the analysis.
    -include-conditions <cond1,cond2> :=  Comma separated list of conditions to include, for the analysis. Conditions not in this list, will be excluded.
    -n   <string>        :=  Normalization method. Default: -n TTR
    -ref <cond>          := which condition(s) to use as a reference for calculating log_fold_changes (comma-separated if multiple conditions)
    -iN  <float>         := Ignore TAs occuring within given percentage (as integer) of the N terminus. Default: -iN 5
    -iC  <float>         := Ignore TAs occuring within given percentage (as integer) of the C terminus. Default: -iC 5
    -PC  <N>             := pseudocounts to use for calculating log_fold_changes. Default: -PC 5
    --winz               := winsorize insertion counts for each gene in each condition (replace max cnt with 2nd highest; helps mitigate effect of outliers)
    -group-by  <string>  := columnname (in samples_metadata) to use as the Condition. Default: "Condition"
    -condition <string>  := alias for -group-by
    -covars       <covar1,covar2...> := Comma separated list of covariates (in metadata file) to include, for the analysis.
    -interactions <covar1,covar2...> := Comma separated list of covariates to include, that interact with the condition for the analysis. Must be factors
    -gene <RV number or Gene name>   := Run method for one gene and print model output.
    --append_gene_desc               := the output_file will have column for gene descriptions
