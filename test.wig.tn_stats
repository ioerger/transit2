# Break-down of total reads (1000):
#  13 reads (1.3%) lack the expected Tn prefix
# Break-down of trimmed reads with valid Tn prefix (983):
#  primer_matches: 8 reads (0.8%) contain CTAGAGGGCCCAATTCGCCCTATAGTGAGT (Himar1)
#  vector_matches: 8 reads (0.8%) contain CTAGACCGTCCAGTCTGGCAGGCCGGAAAC (phiMycoMarT7)
#  adapter_matches: 0 reads (0.0%) contain GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC (Illumina/TruSeq index)
#  misprimed_reads: 0 reads (0.0%) contain Himar1 prefix but don't end in TGTTA
